This is a javascript implementation of finding the shortest path across a three.js mesh.

Try out the [example](https://foobarbecue.github.io/threejs-shortest-path/meshdraw.html). Click on any two faces, and
the script will:
 * Draw a breadth-first search tree on the mesh as a blue spiral
 * Draw the shortest path as a red line
